# Picture to Text Converter

This Python module uses OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to extract text from image files. It leverages OpenCV for image processing and Tesseract OCR via the `pytesseract` wrapper to convert images to text.

## Features

- Reads image files (e.g., PNG, JPG) and extracts text content
- Simple class-based design for easy integration
- Uses Tesseract OCR engine through `pytesseract`

## Requirements

- Python 3.11 or 3.12
- [Tesseract OCR](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) installed and accessible in your system path
- Python dependencies managed via Poetry:
  - `opencv-python`
  - `pytesseract`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd picture-to-text
```
